/* BBRv3: BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control, version 3
 *
 * BBRv3 is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low
 * queues, low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model
 * of the network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as
 * packet loss, if it occurs. Note that although it can use loss signals
 * explicitly, it does not require loss; it can bound its in-flight data based
 * on its estimate of the BDP.
 *
 * For its operating range the model has both a higher/long-term bound and a
 * lower/short-term bound:
 *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
 *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
 * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
 * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
 * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
 * than Reno and CUBIC.
 *
 * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
 *
 *             |
 *             V
 *    +---> STARTUP  ----+
 *    |        |         |
 *    |        V         |
 *    |      DRAIN   ----+
 *    |        |         |
 *    |        V         |
 *    +---> PROBE_BW ----+
 *    |      ^    |      |
 *    |      |    |      |
 *    |      +----+      |
 *    |                  |
 *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
 *
 * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
 * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
 * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
 * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
 * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
 * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
 * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
 * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
 * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a lower value to re-probe
 * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
 * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
 * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
 *
 * BBRv3 is documented in an IETF Internet Draft at:
 *   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccwg-bbr/
 *
 * An earlier version of BBR, BBRv1, is described in detail in:
 *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
 *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
 *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
 *
 * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
 *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
 *
 * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
 * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
 * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.

/*
 *  Ported to the Android Common Kernel (android15-6.6) for StormBreaker.
 *  Upstream: https://github.com/google/bbr
 *  Based on: branch bbr-v3-2026-09-16-01 (18 commits on top of net-next),
 *            net/ipv4/tcp_bbr3.c
 *
 *  Why this file differs from the upstream one
 *  -------------------------------------------
 *  This kernel has a frozen KMI (generation android15-8) and must keep loading
 *  the device's stock vendor modules, which carry symbol CRCs. Any change to a
 *  type reachable from the KMI moves those CRCs, and every vendor module then
 *  fails to load. Four adaptations follow from that, plus two from the older
 *  base:
 *
 *  1. Where the per-socket state lives. Upstream widens ICSK_CA_PRIV_SIZE from
 *     104 to 144 bytes because sizeof(struct bbr3) is 128. That grows
 *     inet_connection_sock, and with it tcp_sock, so it is not available here.
 *     Instead icsk_ca_priv holds a single pointer (struct bbr3_slot) and the
 *     state itself comes from a private kmem_cache. The algorithm is unchanged
 *     -- no field was dropped -- at the cost of one dependent load per
 *     callback and one allocation per connection.
 *
 *     That allocation can fail: ->init() returns void and runs in contexts
 *     that cannot sleep, so it uses GFP_NOWAIT, exactly as tcp_cdg.c does for
 *     its own out-of-line state. When it fails the connection runs in a
 *     DEGRADED MODE rather than dying: every callback returns early, which
 *     leaves the socket on TCP's standard cwnd machinery with Reno's reaction
 *     to loss (tcp_reno_undo_cwnd), internal pacing untouched, and no BBR
 *     model at all. A worse-performing connection, never a broken one.
 *
 *  2. cong_control keeps this kernel's two-argument signature. Upstream passes
 *     (sk, ack, flag, rs); bbr3_main() never reads ack or flag, so widening
 *     the callback -- and with it the ABI of every congestion control module
 *     -- would buy nothing.
 *
 *  3. cwnd_event_tx_start does not exist here. Upstream split CA_EVENT_TX_START
 *     into its own callback; in this kernel ->cwnd_event() still receives the
 *     event, so that handler is folded back into bbr3_cwnd_event().
 *
 *  4. rate_sample and tcp_congestion_ops grew their new members at the END of
 *     the struct instead of in the middle where upstream puts them, so that no
 *     existing member changes offset, and behind #ifndef __GENKSYMS__ so the
 *     symbol CRCs do not move. Field order is irrelevant here.
 *
 *  5. The BPF struct_ops kfunc set is not registered. Upstream gates it on
 *     CONFIG_X86 && CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE, which is false on arm64, so
 *     registering it would only add dead code.
 *
 *  6. Built in (=y), not a module: it is this kernel's default congestion
 *     control, and the same reasoning as the ADIOS backport applies.

 * performance penalty of PROBE_RTT's cwnd capping to roughly 2% (note that
 * the expected bandwidth utilization is 0.5*.2/5 + 1.0*(5 - .2)/5 = 0.98).
 *
 * Note that flows need only pay 2% if they are busy sending over the last 5
 * seconds. Interactive applications (e.g., Web, RPCs, video chunks) often have
